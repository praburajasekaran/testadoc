            <p>I wanted to share a success story that might resonate with you...</p>
            
            <p>Sarah came to me 6 weeks before her IELTS test, targeting Band 7.5 for her university application. Just like you, she was struggling with [WEAK_SECTION] and felt overwhelmed by the lack of structure in her self-study approach.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Her biggest challenges were identical to yours:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>No clear roadmap for [WEAK_SECTION] improvement</li>
                <li>Feeling lost with generic study materials</li>
                <li>Anxiety about the test format and timing</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>What changed everything:</strong></p>
            <p>Instead of trying to improve all sections equally, we focused 70% of her study time on [WEAK_SECTION] with targeted strategies. Within 3 weeks, she saw a 1.5 band improvement in that section alone.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Her results:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Week 2: First practice test - Band 6.5 overall</li>
                <li>Week 4: Second practice test - Band 7.0 overall</li>
                <li>Week 6: Final test - Band 7.5 overall (her target!)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><em>"I couldn't believe how quickly I improved once I had a clear plan and someone to guide me. The personalized feedback on my [WEAK_SECTION] was a game-changer."</em> - Sarah M.</p>
            
            <p>Sarah's success wasn't luck‚Äîit was the result of a proven system and personalized approach. The same system I've outlined in your study plan.</p>

            <div class="email-subject">5 IELTS vocabulary strategies that actually work (not the boring stuff)</div>
            <div class="email-timing">Sent: 10 days after quiz completion</div>
        </div>
        <div class="email-content">
            <p>Hi [FIRST_NAME],</p>
            
            <p>Most IELTS students waste hours memorizing vocabulary lists that never stick. Today, I'm sharing 5 strategies that actually work for building IELTS vocabulary that you'll remember and use correctly.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Strategy 1: The Context Method</strong></p>
            <p>Instead of memorizing isolated words, learn them in phrases and sentences. For example, don't just learn "significant" - learn "significant improvement," "significant impact," "significantly better."</p>
            
            <p><strong>Strategy 2: The Topic Clustering Method</strong></p>
            <p>Group vocabulary by IELTS topics (education, environment, technology, etc.). This mirrors how the test is structured and helps you recall words during the exam.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Strategy 3: The Synonym Ladder</strong></p>
            <p>For each word you learn, find 3-4 synonyms of varying formality levels. This is crucial for Writing Task 2 and Speaking Part 3.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Strategy 4: The Collocation Method</strong></p>
            <p>Learn which words naturally go together. "Make a decision" not "do a decision." "Take responsibility" not "get responsibility."</p>
            
            <p><strong>Strategy 5: The Active Usage Method</strong></p>
            <p>Use new vocabulary in your own sentences within 24 hours of learning it. This moves words from passive to active vocabulary.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Bonus Resource:</strong></p>
            <p>I've created a free IELTS vocabulary tracker that uses these methods. It's helped 200+ students improve their vocabulary scores by 1+ bands.</p>
            
            <a href="#" class="cta-button">Get Free Vocabulary Tracker</a>
            
            <p>Keep practicing with your study plan, and remember - consistency beats perfection every time.</p>

            <p>I want to share an incredible transformation story that might inspire you...</p>
            
            <p>Meet Alex, a 28-year-old engineer who needed Band 8.0 for his PhD application. When he first came to me, he was stuck at Band 6.0 and had already failed the test twice.</p>
            
            <p><strong>His starting point:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Band 6.0 overall (6.0 in all sections)</li>
                <li>3 months to his application deadline</li>
                <li>Working full-time, studying 1-2 hours daily</li>
                <li>Completely demotivated after two failures</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>What we did differently:</strong></p>
            <p>Instead of trying to improve everything at once, we focused on one section at a time with laser precision:</p>
            
            <p><strong>Weeks 1-2: Reading Foundation</strong><br>
            Mastered skimming, scanning, and time management. Result: 6.0 ‚Üí 7.5</p>
            
            <p><strong>Weeks 3-4: Listening Skills</strong><br>
            Focused on prediction and note-taking. Result: 6.0 ‚Üí 8.0</p>
            
            <p><strong>Weeks 5-6: Writing Structure</strong><br>
            Perfected Task 2 essay structure and Task 1 descriptions. Result: 6.0 ‚Üí 7.5</p>
            
            <p><strong>Weeks 7-8: Speaking Confidence</strong><br>
            Mock interviews and fluency building. Result: 6.0 ‚Üí 8.0</p>
            
            <p><strong>Final result: Band 8.0 overall</strong></p>
            
            <p><em>"I couldn't believe it when I saw my results. The systematic approach made all the difference. I went from thinking I'd never reach Band 8 to actually achieving it."</em> - Alex K.</p>
            
            <p><strong>What made Alex's success possible:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Personalized weekly adjustments to his study plan</li>
                <li>Expert feedback on every practice test</li>
                <li>Confidence building through gradual improvement</li>
                <li>Accountability and motivation throughout the process</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Alex's story isn't unique. With the right approach, your target band is absolutely achievable.</p>

            <p>Hi [FIRST_NAME],</p>
            
            <p>I've been thinking about your IELTS journey, and I have to be honest with you...</p>
            
            <p>Three weeks ago, you took our quiz and showed real commitment to improving your IELTS score. You identified your challenges, set your target band, and received a personalized study plan.</p>
            
            <p><strong>But here's what I'm wondering:</strong></p>
            <p>Have you been following the plan consistently? Are you seeing the progress you hoped for?</p>
            
            <p>If you're like most students, you probably started strong but then life got in the way. Maybe you're not sure if you're doing the right things, or you're not seeing results fast enough.</p>
            
            <p><strong>This is exactly why most IELTS students fail.</strong></p>
            
            <p>They have a plan, but they don't have the guidance, accountability, and support to execute it effectively.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Here's what I'm offering you today:</strong></p>
            <p>One final opportunity to work with me personally to ensure your IELTS success.</p>
            
            <p><strong>What you get:</strong></p>
